    \end{center}
        Vehicle speed estimation is an important problem in traffic surveillance, 
        especially large and developing cities. It can be used to monitor conditions 
        and detect problems such as traffic jam and vehicle speed limit violation. 
        The detected vehicle object will be tracked to determine the location in each 
        frame to estimate the speed based on its distance between frames.
